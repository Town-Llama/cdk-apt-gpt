- hypothesis of value:
    - they care about finding things on the menu they like
    - they care about comparing menu items between bars
    - they care about comparing prices
- looking for 80% there to then show users & see the value the persona finds in the tool
- 60% - 80%
    - small prompt optimization is used to help us get to 80%
    - we determine which prompts work best by showing to friends
    - often users put in garbage & get garbage out
    - **how do you check if what the user put in needs to be optimized**
        - "therapist" for search
